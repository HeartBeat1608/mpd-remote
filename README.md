# MPD Remote
> A simpe command manager for mpd using libmpdclient.


### Why ?
I was planning on making youtube videos and having live streams. I needed some way of adding URLs to MPD but ncmpcpp does not allow that and neither did I find it in the mpd help page. I wanted to build something for youtube and so this was born.
